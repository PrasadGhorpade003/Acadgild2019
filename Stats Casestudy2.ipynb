Suppose further that a regional dental association wants to test to determine if this figure is accurate for their area of country. To test this, 22 families of 4 are randomly selected from the population in that area of the country and a log is kept of the family’s dental expenditure for one year. The resulting data are given below. Assuming, that dental expenditure is normally distributed in the population, use the data and an alpha of 0.5 to test the dental association’s hypothesis.\n",
